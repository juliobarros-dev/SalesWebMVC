<h2>SalesWebMVC</h2>

<p>
  This project was developed during my first C# course by teacher Nelio Alves.
  During this project, I could practice many C# and object-oriented programing concepts like classes, heritage, polymorphism, etc.

  I also could understand how MVC architecture works and how to use Razor Pages to make web applications.

  The project consists of a CRUD of sales, sellers, and departments using MySQL to save the information.
